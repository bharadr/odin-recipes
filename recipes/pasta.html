            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>85g of linguini pasta</li>
            <li>50g of diced onions</li>
            <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Prego Marinara Sauce</li>
            <li>3 cups of water</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the pasta, have a small pot on the oven set to medium high. After 2 minutes fill the pot with 6 cups of water.</li>
            <li>Add all 85g of linguini pasta into the small pot, making sure as much of the pasta in submerged in the water.</li>
            <li>The pasta should finish cooking in 10 minutes, stir every 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place a large pot on the oven and turn the heat up to medium high.</li>
            <li>Immediately add the diced onions into the pot along with 1 tbsp of the olive oil.</li>
            <li>Add the tsp of salt to this mix and stir for 2 minutes until the onions become a bit yellow</li>
            <li>Now move the sauteed onions to the side of the pot and add the 8oz of ground beef. Use a spatula to chop the beef up into small segments</li>
            <li>To prevent this mix from drying up, pour 1/4 cup of chicken broth into the pot.</li>
            <li>For 4 minutes, let this mix cook, and then add the 1/2 cup of Prego Marinara Sauce into the mix. Stir thoroughly and let it cook for another 4 minutes, then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>The pasta should be cooked now, so carefully take the small pot, drain the water off with a pasta strainer so that only the cooked pasta is left.</li>
            <li>Pour the cooked pasta into the large pot and mix thoroughly for 30 seconds to 1 minute with the sauce.</li>
            <li>The dish should now be ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
